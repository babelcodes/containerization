# Docker Swarm

> The clustering and orchestration solution from Docker
> - to manage a hosts cluster
> - orchestrate the services of this cluster

![](https://gitlab.com/lucj/docker-exercices/-/raw/master/11.Swarm/images/swarm1.png)
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/

- See [Docker](./README.md)
- Since v1.12, more easy (June, 2016)
- Orchestration integrated to the deamon 
- A Swarm cluster, orchestrator, as [Kubernetes](../kubernetes)
- Define applications with [Docker Compose](./compose.md)
- Reconciliation loop
- Handle (rolling) updates
- Load balancing (VIP)
- Crypted data
- Nodes workers vs. managers
- A Swarm is secured (logs encryption, TLS communication between nodes, certificates rolling)

Primitives
- Node
- Service
- Stack (services group)
- Secret

## Commands

```shell
$ docker swarm --help

$ docker swarm init
$ docker swarm join
```

## RAFT - Distributed Consensus

- http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/
  - [The Raft Paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)
  - [Raft web site](https://raft.github.io/)
- When we have several "server" nodes
- A node can be in 1 of 3 states:
  - `Follower`, the default starting state
  - `Candidaite`, the state if don't hear a `Leader`
  - `Leader`
- Sequence for each node:
  - Start as `Follower`
  - If do not hear a `Leader` become a `Candidate`
  - Request vote from others
  - Receive votes
  - Become the `Leader` if receive vote from a majority (Leader Election)
- All changes to the system go through the `Leader`
- Log Replication
  - Each change is added as an entry in the node's log, as uncommitted
  - First, the `Leader` replicates the entry to the `Follower`s nodes
  - Then, `Leader` waits until a majority of nodes have written the entry
  - Then, the entry is committed on the `Leader`
  - Then, `Leader` notifies the `Followers` that the entry is committed
  - The cluster has now come to consensus about the system state
- Raft (2 timeout settings to control elections)
  - `Election timeout` is the time a `Follower` waits until becoming a `Candidate`
    - Randomized between 150ms and 300ms
  - `Hearbeat timeout` is the interval in which Append Entries messages are sent to `Follower`
- Heartbeats are sent on regular basis
  - Including lifecycle beat
  - And change message

## Node

- Machine included in the Swarm
- Can be
  - `Manager`
    - Schedule and orchestrate containers, if Leader
    - Manage the cluster state
    - RAFT
  - `Worker`
    - Execute containers
  - by default, a manager is also a worker
- States (availability)
  - `Active`, tasks can be assigned (by managers)
  - `Pause`, new task can not be assigned and existing tasks are unchanged
  - `Drain`, new task can not be assigned and existing tasks are stopped and launched on other nodes

### Commands
- Must be addressed to a `Manager` node
  - `inspect`
  - `demote` / `promote`
  - `ls` / `rm` / `update`
```shell
$ docker node --help

Usage:  docker node COMMAND

Manage Swarm nodes

Commands:
  demote      Demote one or more nodes from manager in the swarm
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more nodes
  ls          List nodes in the swarm
  promote     Promote one or more nodes to manager in the swarm
  ps          List tasks running on one or more nodes, defaults to current node
  rm          Remove one or more nodes from the swarm
  update      Update a node

Run 'docker node COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```

## Commands

### Init a Swarm from a node
- The command displays the command to launch from other node to join them to the swarm
- [La plateforme Docker | Udemy - Cr√©ation d'un Swarm](https://www.udemy.com/course/la-plateforme-docker/learn/lecture/13215980#overview)
- https://gitlab.com/lucj/docker-exercices/-/blob/master/11.Swarm/swarm-creation-local.md
```shell
@node1$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.99.100
To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command: docker swarm join --token ...
To add a manager to this swarm, run docker swarm join-token manager ...

@node1$ docker node ls                   # MUST BE LAUNCHED FROM A MANAGER
ID     HOSTNAME     STATUS     AVAILABILITY     MANAGER     STATUS
```

### Attach a worker
```shell
@node2$ docker swarm join --token ...
```

### Attach a manager
```shell
@node1$ docker swarm join-token manager  # MUST BE LAUNCHED FROM A MANAGER
To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command: docker swarm join --token ...

@node3$ docker swarm join --token ...    # MUST BE LAUNCHED FROM the manager candidate (node *3*)

@node1$ docker node ls                   # MUST BE LAUNCHED FROM A MANAGER
ID          HOSTNAME     STATUS     AVAILABILITY     MANAGER     STATUS
1m9...      node3        Ready      Active           Reachable
lf2...  *   node1        Ready      Active           Leader
pes...      node2        Ready      Active           

@node1$ docker node inspect -f '{{ json .Spec }}' node1
{
    "Labels": {},
    "Role": "manager",
    "Availability": "active"
}
```

### Manager: Promote (to) & demote (from)
```shell
@node1$ docker node demote node1         # MUST BE LAUNCHED FROM A MANAGER (node 1)
                                         # The remaining manager (node3) is automatically promoted as LEADER
@node3$ docker node promote node2        # MUST BE LAUNCHED FROM A MANAGER (node *3*)

@node2$ docker node ls                   # MUST BE LAUNCHED FROM A MANAGER (node *2*)
ID          HOSTNAME     STATUS     AVAILABILITY     MANAGER     STATUS
1m9...      node3        Ready      Active           Leader
lf2...  *   node1        Ready      Active           
pes...      node2        Ready      Active           Reachable
```

### Availability
- Among: `Active`, `Pause`, `Drain`
- Manage task deployment on a node 
```shell
@node1$ docker node update --availability pause node2
@node1$ docker node update --availability drain node2
@node1$ docker node update --availability active node2
@node1$ docker node inspect -f '{{ json .Spec }}' node2
{
    "Labels": {},
    "Role": "worker",
    "Availability": "active"
}
```

### Labels
- Facilitate nodes management, as tags
```shell
@node1$ docker node inspect -f '{{ json .Spec.Labels }}' node1
{}

@node1$ docker node update --label-add Memcached=true node1
@node1$ docker node inspect -f '{{ json .Spec.Labels }}' node1 | jq .
{
    "Memcached": "true"
}
```

## Service

- Since 1.12
- Launch the containers
- Mode `replicated` or `global`
- Service discovery
- Publish port / routing mesh (ex: can access to a webapp on each node even if no replicas)

Configuration
- Used image
- Deployment mode
- Exposed ports
- Secrets
- Boot strategy
- Deployment constraints
- Updates
- Resources
- Health check
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_create/

Tasks
- A `service`
  - Launches N `tasks` (replicas) and for each:
    - Is deployed on a `mode`
    - Executes a `container`

![](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/images/services-diagram.png)
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/services/

### Commands
```shell
$ docker service --help

Commands:
  create      Create a new service
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more services
  logs        Fetch the logs of a service or task
  ls          List services
  ps          List the tasks of one or more services
  rm          Remove one or more services

```

### Create
Create a service:
````shell

````

Example of a database:
````shell
$ docker service create                       \
    --mount type=volume,src=data,dst=/data/db \
    --name db                                 \

### Rolling upgrade
- By default update a replica and go to the next
````shell
$ docker service create    \
    --update-parallelism 2 \      # Replicats updated 2 by 2
    --update-delay 10s     \      # Wait 10s before update next replicas pool
    --replicas 4           \
    --publish 27017:27017  \
    --name vote            \
    instavote/vote

$ docker service update --image instavote/vote:indent vote
````

### Service rollback
````shell
$ docker service create    \
    --publish 27017:27017  \
    --name vote            \
    instavote/vote
$ docker service inspect vote     # .Spec

$ docker service update --image instavote/vote:indent vote
$ docker service inspect vote     # .Spec and .PreviousSpec

$ docker service rollback vote
````
